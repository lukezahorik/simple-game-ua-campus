#1"You are standing at the front steps of Gorgas Library. The building towers in front of you, giving you a sense of awe, and making you realize you have no hope of graduating. To your south is Denny Chimes, to your East, Llyod, to the West, Bidgood hall, and to your North, the glorious Ferguson center."
#2"You are in the Ferguson center parking lot. To your left, a parking attendant is writing a meaningless ticket, simply because they want to ruin someone's day. To your south is the Ferguson center."
#3"You're at the Ferguson center. The smell of Panda Express, Wendys, and Auntie Annes washes over you. Nearby you hear a student loudly complaining about how their dining dollars are out, and that they have to eat at Lakeside now. To your south is Gorgas, East is Shelby, South is Gorgas, and West is Marr's spring."
#4"You are at Marr's Spring. It's picturesque, with the hustle and bustle of campus suddenly gone. There is a man sitting on a bench nearby, appearing to be asleep. To your North is the parking lot, to your east, the Ferguson center, and to your south, Bidgood."
#5"You're at the steps of Shelby hall. As you gaze upon it's glory, you notice several engineering students walk out and furiously run to Rodgers to study. They all look broken at this point in the semester, and you feel some pity for them. To your south is Rodgers Library. To your West, the Ferguson parking lot."
#6"You're at Rodger's library. As you look around, you see the following; A student playing League of Legends; A student having a panic attack; 3 students sleeping; a student working on their last CS project"
